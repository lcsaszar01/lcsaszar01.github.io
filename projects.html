                            Designed standard cells in 0.5u technology which met lambda design rules and passed DRC, LVS, and extraction tests using
                            Cadence Virtuoso, Layout GXL, and Analog Place and Route, as well as synthesized a MIPS 8-bit microprocessor using Genus

                            Designed and implemented a smart watering system for lawn gardens to improve water conservation. Using off-the-shelf parts, we demonstrated our Arduino sensorsâ€™ capabilities to read and transmit data to our web server to send to the mock
                            sprinkler system model to water the lawn zone in need.

                        <li>This is a graduation requirement by Saint Mary's College, I was paired with Dr. Mary Porter as my supervisor on this project. </li>
                        <li>Reserach extensitve on the topic of automata theory, focusing on Finite State Machines.</li>
                        <li>Presented 2 short talks to classmates to gage their understanding and recieve feedback</li>
                        <li> Gave a 40 minute presentation on the topic and had open Q/A from the class professors.and 2 department professorsm, one of which was my advisor. 
                            This pannel of three professors had also read the paper ahead of time and asked questions related to both the presentationa and the paper. </li>

                        <li>This is a graduation requirement by Saint Mary's College, I was paired with Dr. Mary Porter as my supervisor on this project. </li>
                        <li>Reserach extensitve on the topic of automata theory, focusing on Finite State Machines.</li>
                        <li>Presented 2 short talks to classmates to gage their understanding and recieve feedback</li>
                        <li> Gave a 40 minute presentation on the topic and had open Q/A from the class professors.and 2 department professorsm, one of which was my advisor. 
                            This pannel of three professors had also read the paper ahead of time and asked questions related to both the presentationa and the paper. </li>

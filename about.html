    Born and raised in Indiana, staying in state for college was the obvious choice.
    I graduated in 2018 from Indiana Connections Acadamy with Indiana's Core 40 with Academic Honors Diploma.
    From there I commited to Saint Mary's College B.S in Computing and Applied Mathematics with a Duel Degree at the University of Notre Dame. This 4+1 program allows students at Saint Mary's College to persue a second B.S. in the engineering discipline of their choice. In the Spring of 2020 I declared a B.S. of Computer Engineering within the Department of Computer Science and Enginnering at Notre Dame.
